It's a stereo widening tool, which essentially uses a ton of allpass filters to let you place elements in the mix.
Each channel has a distance (number of allpass filters), a cutoff frequency and a resonance (width of cutoff) parameter.
You can also change it from L/R to M/S mode and there's a button that helps with checking for mono compatibility.
